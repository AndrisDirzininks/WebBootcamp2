Hello, Here you can find and purchase drums that I make.

There are two types. Tank drums and log drums.

For few years I am making these drums from steel propane balloons. A tank drum is a wonderful deep and vibrating musical instrument. It’s good to recycle and make something so beautiful from old tanks. I really love to polish and color them in this unique way by heating them to the special natural metal color changing temperature at 300°C. You never know what will it turn out. Ah, if you don’t know what a tank drum is yet … made from 5 liter steel propane balloons, it has vibrating tongues (my drums have 7-8 tongues).
Each tongue has a different note in a conventional musical scale. I play tank drums with two mallets. Size of a drum is approx. 22 cm diameter and 17 cm height, the weight - around 2 kg.

And recently I’m working to make log drums. These instruments are somewhat more complicated to make and I have some help from a really fine carpenter and also a laser cut studio. A log drum is really similar to a tank drum in many ways. It is also played with mallets (or bare hand if you have the skill), it has vibrating tongues (my instruments have 6-12) that are tuned in a precise scale (usually in a pentatonic one). Only the material differs, a log drum is made entirely from wood, it has a box shape with dimensions approx. 45x20x20cm for a large one instrument. It’s also quite heavy and can weight up to 3 kg.

And thank you so much all the people who have and are still helping me to develop this. Everyone needs so much help to do something new and special, I'm thankful that I really had it.

A nice cataloque of my tank drums can be viewed

You can get a instrument by mail also in the <a href="/manalapa/?nav=shop">Shop</a> page.

And the best and most personal way would be to visit me at my place in Riga city center near Ziedondarzs park (Artilerijas street 33), it's around 15 min. walk from the railway station and if you come by car you can leave it in the house parking yard. Here you could check the sound and the look for yourself. You can surely contact me here or in FB and I will surely reply soon.

See you -
Andris
